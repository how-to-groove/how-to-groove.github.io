<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Getting fantastics feels fantastic. There’s nothing like the feeling of crispy steps under your feet. When the sounds of your steps are so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQMlWwIXg3M">in-sync</a> with the music they blend into the music as though they are part of the music itself, it is euphoric. But this isn’t what ITG is like most of the time; most of the time we’re fighting, confused, tired, frustrated. Failing. It seems impossible. A quint? How could I possibly quint something?</p>

<p>You can quint something, eventually, if you try.</p>

<p>I’d like to start by saying that there are only two universal truths to getting better at timing: <em>there is no substitute for practice</em> (though there is good practice and bad practice), and <em>every player learns differently</em>. Reading this guide will not give immediate results. Instead, I hope to equip you with better tools as you work towards your goals. I don’t have the means to research what works on a larger scale, but I’d like share with you things that I believe, at the time of this writing, to have worked well for me. There is no certain path to quinting. If something in here isn’t working out for you, work to find your own path.</p>

<h2 id="count-the-beat">Count the Beat</h2>

<h3 id="dont-rely-on-the-scroll-to-tell-you-when-to-step-count-the-beat-yourself-and-play-to-that">Don’t rely on the scroll to tell you when to step. Count the beat yourself and play to that.</h3>

<p>Any ITG player will recognize the colors of the notes: Red, Blue, Green, Purple. Most players know that when we say “8th notes” we’re talking about reds and blues. But why is it called an “8th note”, exactly?</p>

<p>To answer that, first let’s talk about the <em>downbeat</em>, or the first beat in the <em>measure</em>. In most music in ITG every beat is evenly spaced apart, and there are 4 beats per measure. That means there are 4 spots for red notes between each downbeat, and the distance between each red note is one quarter of the time between the downbeats. An “8th note” is the same: it’s one eighth the time it takes to go from one downbeat to the next.</p>

<p>If we know where the downbeat is, we can start our counting there. If we count “one, two, three, four” along the red notes (or the empty spots where a red note would be), we know one measure has passed, and we are onto the next downbeat and we can start again at “one”. The specifics aren’t important: you can imagine a metronome, the assist-tick sound, or anything else that feels comfortable to you. What matters is that you are consciously keeping track of the beat.</p>

<p>“Okay,” you might say, “how does this help me keep time? I can already tell the time between notes by listening to the music and watching the arrows without doing any of this.”</p>

<p>That’s true! And you can play perfectly fine this way. I’ve had some very good scores playing without thinking. But playing like that is <em>passive</em>. If we want to time at the very best of our abilities, then we need to be <em>deliberate</em> about timing. If you want to quint, there is no room for mistakes. You can’t even afford one single white fantastic! Counting enables us to be deliberate.</p>

<p>Why does that matter?</p>

<p>When you’re just reading arrow-by-arrow, you’re in a <em>reaction</em> driven loop: you see the next arrow, and using your experience and your subconscious sense of timing you prepare for how much time it will take to reach the top of the screen. You step on the arrow, get feedback, respond to that feedback, and move on to the next arrow (or chunk of arrows).</p>

<p>When you’re counting the beat you’re in an <em>action</em> driven loop: You are setting the time, and you are in control of your own beat. You know in advance when the “two” is coming after the “one” and you are prepared to step. The arrows on screen still tell you when to step, you still respond to the feedback, but you’ve taken control over the timing. We’ve stopped asking the game the question “did I anticipate that arrow correctly?” and started asking “is my internal clock in sync?”</p>

<p>This does more than just improve your accuracy in a run (it probably will make it worse, at first): it lets you scrutinize your internal sense of time and develop a strong internal metronome, and that is invaluable if you want to hone your timing skills.</p>

<h2 id="ghost-step">Ghost Step</h2>

<h3 id="your-bodys-sense-of-time-and-your-minds-sense-of-time-should-be-effortlessly-connected-ghost-stepping-helps-enforce-that-connection">Your body’s sense of time and your mind’s sense of time should be effortlessly connected. Ghost stepping helps enforce that connection.</h3>

<p>When we are counting the beat and keeping our internal metronome, this gives us psychological control over our sense of time. But ITG is a <em>physical</em> game, and that sense is meaningless if we can’t also easily connect it with our bodies. We shouldn’t have to think to translate a beat into a step. We should be stepping automatically in sync with our internal metronome. We can reinforce this by <em>ghost stepping</em>.</p>

<p>What is ghost stepping? Ghost stepping is when you step when there is no note. That’s it. When you are counting in your head, if there’s a long blank, don’t just stand there. Step where the beat would land. Work on integrating this more and more as you play. Eventually you will start doing it without even needing to think about it.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="play-with-confidence">Play With Confidence</h2>

<h3 id="you-have-an-internal-metronome-trust-it">You have an internal metronome. Trust it.</h3>

<p>As you play, you might feel a tension between what people call “visual” and “audio” timing. Visual timing is a necessary part of this game and you can’t discard it completely (especially when it comes to complex rhythms that are otherwise hard to recognize on the fly), but try to play as though your counting is perfect. Trust it and strike with confidence. You will inevitably make mistakes, but self-doubt, overthinking, and anxiety can quickly collapse your internal sense of time. Relax, stay comfortable, and trust yourself.</p>

<p>This doesn’t mean to <em>ignore</em> your mistakes. But tensing up won’t improve anything. Stay lose and play as though the song is effortless for you. Even if it’s not.</p>

<h2 id="triage-your-mental-stack">Triage Your Mental Stack</h2>

<h3 id="itg-is-too-fast-to-think-about-everything-at-once-prioritize-what-your-active-thoughts-are-focused-on">ITG is too fast to think about everything at once. Prioritize what your active thoughts are focused on.</h3>

<p>This won’t make sense just yet, but we’ll come back to this at the end: <em>Judgement. Collective. Tomorrow. Break. Vortex.</em></p>

<p>Most of us can only keep so many things in our working memory at a time. As a rule of thumb, I like to think that the player is only actively aware of about 3 things at a time. This is a very broad generalization, of course, but it’s important knowledge to us as players and as designers. We can’t proiritize everything.</p>

<p>In fighting games we often call this “mental stack”. If you’re thinking about too many things at once, the stack fills up and you lose track of less important things. In Street Fighter, any time someone jumps at a Ryu player, that Ryu player has the perfect response: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBGDwQKF1cM">SHORYUKEN</a>! But they only have a few fractions of a second to respond to the jump in. If your opponent has been behaving predictably on the ground and then suddenly jumps, you won’t have time to react even though it’s a perfectly punishable move.</p>

<p>The same is true for ITG. If you want strong timing, timing needs to be triaged. Allow timing to take center stage. Learn to understand charts so you don’t have to think so much to read them. Keep focus on timing even when you’re struggling.</p>

<p>This may seem like a tall order, but charts are often interested in your success. I tend to think of playing a chart as like a dialog with the chart author. They are trying to tell you what to do! <em>listen to them</em>. They probably gave you hints about what was going to happen! Pay attention!</p>

<p>By the way, what were the 5 words from earlier? No cheating!</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="think-critically">Think Critically</h2>

<h3 id="learn-to-identify-the-nuances-in-your-individual-play-patterns">Learn to identify the nuances in your individual play patterns.</h3>

<p>Everyone is different. No two players see the game the same way. Don’t take anything I’ve said as gospel. You need to look at your own skillset and be critical of what you’re doing. I can’t tell you what will work best for you or where your deficiencies are. A lot of this game is self-discovery.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="be-kind">Be Kind</h2>

<h3 id="be-kind-to-yourself-and-to-others-lift-up-your-friends-and-let-them-lift-you-up-in-return">Be kind to yourself and to others. Lift up your friends, and let them lift you up in return.</h3>

<p>There is no valor to be found in being skilled at ITG. Other players may surpass your skills while you’re feeling like you’re stuck with no results, but that doesn’t make them a better person than you. It will do you well to remember that we are all trying to have fun and enjoy a video game together. Celebrate their successes, and keep working on your own.</p>

<p>If you never quint anything, that’s ok too. At the end of the day, your best is all you have and your best is all you can do. Sometimes we decide that we want to do other things with our time. If you just want to play hard stuff, go play hard stuff. We only have so much time on this planet; there’s no sense in wasting it doing something you don’t want to do.</p>
